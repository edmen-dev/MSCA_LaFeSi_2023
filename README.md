# marmot_files_hdf5
This repository contains the basic structure to save inputs and outputs of marmot code in hdf5 files, including also the creation of metadata.

# check with EV
- Can we put experimental data available as default? When?
- Zenodo vs internal cluster
- Is Zenodo free or you should work on section 3?
- Think how GITHUB could play a nice role on the DMP.
- Learn about how Zenodo secures your data.
- sharePoint - base de dades amb atributs - 
- WE WILL PUT IT IN SHAREPOINT

# To do
- Am I fitting well the metadata for Zenodo? (https://zenodo.org/schemas/deposits/records/legacyrecord.json)
- Accepted in json file: strings, true, false, integer, float, null
    - use strings, true/false for safety
- Add a CIF of your crystal structure?
- How should I handle the final output of marmot?
    - Add a script that manages all the output data?
    - Add final pdf figures?
