Remarkably, such a transition shows a large spontaneous volume change together with itinerant electron metamagnetic features. While magnetovolume effects are well-established mechanisms driving first-order transitions, purely electronic sources have a long, subtle history and remain poorly understood. Here we apply a disordered local moment picture to quantify electronic and magnetoelastic effects at finite temperature in La(FexSi1\u2212x)13 from first-principles. We obtain results in very good agreement with experiment and demonstrate that the magnetoelastic coupling drives the first-order character and causes at the same time a huge electronic entropy contribution to the caloric response."
